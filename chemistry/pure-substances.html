      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Right! Pure substances. I like how you remembered the particles first, because it's easy
        to understand <strong>pure substances</strong> as substances made of only <strong>one kind of particle</strong>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> So if I have a necklace made of pure gold, that means it only contains gold particles,
        which are atoms, right?</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Exactly. And if there are any other atoms mixed in, then it’s no longer a pure
        substance.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> What do we call substances that aren’t pure?</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> We call them mixtures, and we’ll talk about them in one of our next lessons.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> That was easy. One type of particle = <strong>pure substance</strong>. More than one
        type = <strong>mixture</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Exactly. Now, what do you think: are there more pure substances or mixtures around us?
      </p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Probably more mixtures, since particles are always moving and mixing with each other.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> You're right. It's actually pretty hard to find a truly pure substance in nature.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Yeah, but chemists have come up with cool ways to separate and purify mixtures to get
        pure substances.</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> You already know everything!</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> I do — but it’s more fun learning with you.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Gold – A Pure Substance That Drove Entire Nations</h3>
    <p>Gold is often found in nature as a pure substance — in shiny pieces called nuggets.</p>
    <p>Throughout history, people have set off on long expeditions just to search for gold!</p>
    <p>In the 1800s, the famous <strong>Gold Rushes</strong> took place in California, Australia, and Alaska. Thousands
      left their homes, hoping to find gold and change their lives.</p>
    <p>One popular method was <strong>panning for gold</strong> — people would stand in cold rivers and swirl sand in
      shallow pans, hoping to spot tiny shiny flakes of pure gold.</p>
    <p>Today we know that gold is not only beautiful but also chemically very special. It doesn't easily react with
      other substances, doesn't rust or tarnish — making it a perfect example of a <strong>pure substance</strong>.</p>
