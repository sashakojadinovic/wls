            <p class="bubble answer">Hi Sara. Chemistry is everywhere—inside us, and all around us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-mix show-after-3" data-speaker="Mark and Sara">

            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>That’s not exactly what I meant, but go on. I love listening to you talk.
                😊</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Then listen closely. Chemistry is a wonderful science.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>And what does this wonderful science actually study? I’d love for the
                object of my admiration to explain the object of his favorite science. 😊</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Chemistry studies matter, so we can say that the main focus of chemistry
                is matter itself.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>And what exactly is matter?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. There are so many
                examples that I’m actually struggling to think of something that isn’t made of matter.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>What about love, Mark? Love doesn’t have mass or take up space...
                although it does feel like butterflies are filling my stomach right now.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>You’re right. Love is an emotion—it’s not matter. But everything around
                us, including ourselves, is made of matter.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>So you’re saying, for example, that my phone is an object made of
                different types of matter—like plastic, glass, and metal?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Exactly. And by the way, there are many types of plastic. I happen to
                know that your phone is made of a kind of plastic called polycarbonate, and the metal parts are
                made of aluminum.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>I like how you “just happened” to find out what my phone is made of. 😏
            </p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>I love learning everything about science, Sara.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong> Love, huh? That sounds kind of romantic, Mark.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Believe it or not, if we study love scientifically, we’ll end up back in
                chemistry—there are actual substances behind the feeling of being in love.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>So there is chemistry between us. I knew it! 😍</p>

            <p class="bubble info">The word “chemistry” comes from an old Egyptian word khem that means “black earth.”
                This was the name for the rich soil near the Nile River. A long time ago, chemistry started as something
                called alchemy — which was kind of like magic mixed with early science. It’s a bit like what you see in
                Harry Potter when wizards mix potions and do spells!</p>
