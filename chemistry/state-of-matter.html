    <h1>State of matter</h1>
    <h2>Three states of matter that can be seen in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas</h2>
    <p class="intro">
  What is a state of matter? It’s the form that a substance takes—like solid, liquid, or gas. In this lesson, we’ll explain the meaning of each state, how particles behave in them, and give fun examples that are easy to understand!

        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-mix show-after-3" data-speaker="Mark and Sara">
            <p><strong>Mark:</strong>You just mentioned ice. Are ice and water the same thing?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Hmm, not really. I mean, water is liquid and ice is solid, but they can turn into
                each other pretty easily. So... I don’t know.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Let me ask it in a different way. Are ice and water made of the same substance?
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>They’re made of the same particles—we call them molecules. In this case, both
                water and ice are made of H₂O molecules. So yeah, I guess that means they’re the same substance.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark:</strong>That’s right, Sara! If they’re made of the same particles, then ice, liquid water,
                and water vapor are all the same substance. They’re all made of H₂O molecules.
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong> Then why don’t they look the same, if they’re made of the same stuff? </p>
            <p><strong>Mark:</strong>Good question! It’s because in these three forms—what we call the states of
                matter—the particles (in this case, water molecules) are arranged differently. They’re spaced out
                differently and move at different speeds.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Okay… now I’m lost. Draw it for me.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark:</strong> I’ll explain it first—then you try drawing it! <br>
                In the solid state, the particles are packed tightly together. There’s very little space between them
                and they move very slowly. That’s why solids usually take up less space than liquids or gases.
                In the liquid state, the particles move a bit faster, so they’re a little farther apart and not as
                strongly connected.
                And in the gas state, the particles are moving really fast—in all directions! They bounce off each other
                and the space between them is much bigger than in solids and liquids.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Ohhh! That actually makes sense. It’s like how hotter things are different from
                colder ones because their particles are moving faster. The hotter it gets, the faster they move?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark:</strong>Exactly! And the faster the particles move, the more they crash into each other—and
                the more chaos there is. That’s why the state of a substance depends on the temperature.
                When we heat up a solid, the particles move faster and faster, the connections between them get weaker,
                and eventually the solid “breaks apart” and becomes a liquid.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Wow, Marko—your heart may be cold, but your words and ideas are definitely
                flowing! 😄</p>

                <p>Most people learn that matter exists in three states — solid, liquid, and gas. But
                    there’s more! Scientists have discovered other, less common states of matter. One of them is called
                    plasma — and it’s actually the most common state of matter in the entire universe!</p>

            </div>
        </div>
    </section>
    <h3>So, what is plasma?</h3>
    <p> Plasma is a super-hot gas where the atoms have been “ripped apart.” The electrons break away from
        the
        atoms, so instead of neutral particles, you get a mix of positively charged particles and free
        electrons. This makes plasma able to carry electricity and react to magnetic fields. <br>

        You can find plasma in lightning, neon signs, and even in the Sun and all the stars. So while we
        don’t
        see it much on Earth, it's literally lighting up the universe! <br>

        And if that’s not wild enough — there’s also a super-strange state called Bose–Einstein condensate,
        where matter acts like a single super-atom when it gets unbelievably cold. We're talking colder than
        outer space!</p>
